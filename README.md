# kond3_bash_scripts
This is my first repository on github, and with it I want to share some scripts I use, in combination with aliases, to make my bash life easier. 

Lines in alias.txt should be added to either your $HOME/.bashrc or (if $HOME/.bashrc is configured to import it) to $HOME/bash.alias. This can be done manually (requiring to create a directory named "Scripts" in $HOME, where to copy file found in this repo's script directory) or through configure.sh
